## Building a Custom Wordlist
Let's start from this single password list:

```shell
> cat password.list

password
```

We can use Hashcat to combine lists of potential names and labels with specific mutation rules to create custom wordlists.
The complete syntax is documented in the official [Hashcat rule-based attack documentation](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule_based_attack), but the examples below are sufficient to understand how Hashcat mutates input words.

| **Function** | **Description**                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `:`          | Do nothing                                       |
| `l`          | Lowercase all letters                            |
| `u`          | Uppercase all letters                            |
| `c`          | Capitalize the first letter and lowercase others |
| `sXY`        | Replace all instances of X with Y                |
| `$!`         | Add the exclamation character at the end         |
Each rule is written on a new line and determines how a given word should be transformed.

```shell
> cat custom.rule

:
c
so0
c so0
sa@
c sa@
c sa@ so0
$!
$! c
$! so0
$! sa@
$! c so0
$! c sa@
$! so0 sa@
$! c so0 sa@
```

We can use the following command to apply the rules in `custom.rule` to each word in `password.list` and store the mutated results in `mut_password.list`.

```shell
hashcat --force password.list -r custom.rule --stdout | sort -u > mut_password.list
```

## Generating wordlists using CeWL

We can use a tool called [CeWL](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL) to scan potential words from a company's website.
We specify some parameters, like the depth to spider (`-d`), the minimum length of the word (`-m`), the storage of the found words in lowercase (`--lowercase`), as well as the file where we want to store the results (`-w`).

```shell
cewl https://www.inlanefreight.com -d 4 -m 6 --lowercase -w inlane.wordlist
```
