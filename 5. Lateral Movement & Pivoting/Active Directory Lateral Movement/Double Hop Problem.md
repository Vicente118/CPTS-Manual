When we connect to `DEV01` using a tool such as `evil-winrm`, we connect with network authentication, so our credentials are not stored in memory and, therefore, will not be present on the system to authenticate to other resources on behalf of our user. When we load a tool such as `PowerView` and attempt to query Active Directory, Kerberos has no way of telling the DC that our user can access resources in the domain.

This happens because the user's Kerberos TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) ticket is not sent to the remote session; therefore, the user has no way to prove their identity, and commands will no longer be run in this user's context.

If unconstrained delegation is enabled on a server, it is likely we won't face the "Double Hop" problem.
## Workarounds
#### Workaround #1: PSCredential Object
```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> $SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString '!qazXSW@' -AsPlainText -Force

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents>  $Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm', $SecPassword)
```

now if we pass $Cred in our next command it will work:
```powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> get-domainuser -spn -credential $Cred | select samaccountname
```


#### Workaround #2: Register PSSession Configuration (Best one)
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Register-PSSessionConfiguration -Name backupadmsess -RunAsCredential inlanefreight\backupadm
```
Once this is done, we need to restart the WinRM service by typing `Restart-Service WinRM` in our current PSSession. This will kick us out, so we'll start a new PSSession using the named registered session we set up previously.

After we start the session, we can see that the double hop problem has been eliminated, and if we type `klist`, we'll have the cached tickets necessary to reach the Domain Controller.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Enter-PSSession -ComputerName DEV01 -Credential INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm -ConfigurationName  backupadmsess

[DEV01]: PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> klist

krbtgt Ticket is now here !
