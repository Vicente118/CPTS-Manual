#### Interception Responses
In Burp, we can enable response interception by going to (`Proxy>Proxy settings`) and enabling `Intercept Response` under `Response interception rules`:

#### Automatic Request Modification
We can go to (`Proxy>Proxy settings>HTTP match and replace rules`) and click on `Add` in Burp. As the screenshot below shows, we will set the following options:

#### Automatic Response Modification
Let us go back to (`Proxy>Options>Match and Replace`) in Burp to add another rule. This time we will use the type of `Response body` since the change we want to make exists in the response's body and not in its headers.

#### Proxying Tools With Proxychains
To route all web requests made by a specific tool through our web proxy tools, we have to set them up as the tool's proxy.
We first have to edit `/etc/proxychains.conf`
```shell
#socks4         127.0.0.1 9050
http 127.0.0.1 8080
```
Every request sent with proxychains will go throught 127.0.0.1:8080, which is our Burp proxy.
```shell
proxychains -q curl http://SERVER_IP:PORT
```
