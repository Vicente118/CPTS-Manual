## Bypass Basic Authentication 

Simply try in burp to change request method. If it does not work try OPTIONS to see which method are allowed and them. Exemple HEAD.
## Bypassing Security Filters
In the `File Manager` web application, if we try to create a new file name with special characters in its name (e.g. `test;`), we get an error. Try to change the request method to see if it works.
