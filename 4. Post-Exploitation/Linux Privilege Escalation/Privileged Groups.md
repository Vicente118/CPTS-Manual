```shell
docker run -v /root:/mnt -it ubuntu
```

## Disk
Users within the disk group have full access to any devices contained within `/dev`, such as `/dev/sda1`, which is typically the main device used by the operating system. An attacker with these privileges can use `debugfs` to access the entire file system with root level privileges.

---
## ADM
Members of the adm group are able to read all logs stored in `/var/log`. This does not directly grant root access, but could be leveraged to gather sensitive data stored in log files or enumerate user actions and running cron jobs.
