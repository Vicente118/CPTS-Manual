Many services may be found, which have flaws that can be leveraged to escalate privileges. An example is the popular terminal multiplexer [Screen](https://linux.die.net/man/1/screen). Version 4.5.0 suffers from a privilege escalation vulnerability due to a lack of a permissions check when opening a log file.

Look up on Google if CVE exists for unusual services on the machine.
