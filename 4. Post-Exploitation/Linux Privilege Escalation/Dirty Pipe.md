All kernels from version `5.8` to `5.17` are affected and vulnerable to this vulnerability.
For example, we could edit the `/etc/passwd` file and remove the password prompt for the root. This would allow us to log in with the `su` command without the password prompt.
To exploit this vulnerability, we need to download a [PoC](https://github.com/AlexisAhmed/CVE-2022-0847-DirtyPipe-Exploits) and compile it on the target system itself or a copy we have made.
#### Compile
```
bash compile.sh
```
The first exploit version (`exploit-1`) modifies the `/etc/passwd` and gives us a prompt with root privileges.
#### Exploitation
```shell
./exploit-1
```
