General Syntax:
```shell
hashcat -a 0 -m 0 <hashes> [wordlist, rule, mask, ...]
```
`-a`: Attack mode
`-m`: Hash type
The hashcat website hosts a comprehensive list of [example hashes](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) which can assist in manually identifying an unknown hash.

#### Dictionary attack `-a 0`
```shell
hashcat -a 0 -m 0 e3e3ec5831ad5e7288241960e5d4fdb8 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
##### Additioning Rules
```shell
ls -l /usr/share/hashcat/rules
```

```shell
hashcat -a 0 -m 0 1b0556a75770563578569ae21392630c /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule
```

#### Mask attack `-a 3`
If we know that a password is eight characters long, rather than attempting every possible combination, we might define a mask that tests combinations of six letters followed by two numbers.

A mask is defined by combining a sequence of symbols, each representing a built-in or custom character set.

| Symbol | Charset                             |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| ?l     | abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz          |
| ?u     | ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ          |
| ?d     | 0123456789                          |
| ?h     | 0123456789abcdef                    |
| ?H     | 0123456789ABCDEF                    |
| ?s     | «space»!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[]^_`{ |
| ?a     | ?l?u?d?s                            |
| ?b     | 0x00 - 0xff                         |

Let's say that we specifically want to try passwords which start with an uppercase letter, continue with four lowercase letters, a digit, and then a symbol. The resulting hashcat mask would be `?u?l?l?l?l?d?s`.

```shell
hashcat -a 3 -m 0 1e293d6912d074c0fd15844d803400dd '?u?l?l?l?l?d?s'
```
