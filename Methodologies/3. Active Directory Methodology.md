## Enumeration (No Credentials)
#### Host identification
- [ ] Wireshark layer 2 (ARP, MDNS,...) to discover IPs and Hostnames
- [ ] Responder Analyze mode to discover IPs and Hostnames
- [ ] Ping sweep
- [ ] Nmap (If not already done)
	- [ ] Look for outdated services / OS
	- [ ] Document every informations found
#### User Identification
- [ ] SMB null session
- [ ] RPC null session enum users
- [ ] Ldap Anonymous enum users
- [ ] Lookupsid.py to discover users with SID/RID brute forcing
- [ ] Kerbrute with a user wordlist that respect naming convention of the organization
- [ ] ASREP-ROASTING
	- [ ] Crack hashes found
- [ ] Check for vulnerable service that will gain us SYSTEM Access on a machine. (It's like having first foothold on the AD infrastructure)
#### User Foothold 
- [ ] Responder / Inveigh -> LLMNR&NBT-NS Poisoning
	- [ ] Crack hashes found
- [ ] Password spraying on users found
	- [ ] Attempt to get password policy first to filter wordlist
	- [ ] Try common password like 'Welcome1'

## Enumeration (With Credentials)
#### Host Identification
- [ ] Run Bloodhound and mark as owned users that we owned
- [ ] ldapdomaindump to identify all domain joined computers
- [ ] Enumerate all accessible shares and files
	- [ ] Manspider
	- [ ] NetExec
	- [ ] Snaffler
	- [ ] SMBmap
	- [ ] LaZagne
#### User Identification
- [ ] Gather the domain password policy if not already done
- [ ] Gather all users / groups / logged-on users against the server we control with NetExec
- [ ] Make a List of Domain Admins and Privileges Users with Bloodhound and Powerview
- [ ] FULL Credential Enumeration from Linux
- [ ] FULL Credential Enumeration from Windows
#### Foothold Enumeration
- [ ] Enumerate Security Controls in place
- [ ] Look for logged oon users with netexec to see if we can dump any credentials with mimikatz or rubeus
- [ ] Kerberoasting with GetuserSPNs.py and bloodhound for checks
- [ ] ACL Eumeration: Look at owned users for abusable ACLs entries 
- [ ] Check on bloodhound for CanRDP, CanPSRemote OR SQLAdmin to move laterally

#### Exploitation 
- [ ] Get TGS tickets with getuserspns.py and attempt to crack them.
- [ ] Abuse ACL permissive entries:
	- [ ] *ForceChangePassword* to change password of a user
	- [ ] *AddMember* to add a member we control to a privileged group
	- [ ] *GenericAll/GenericWrite*: Create SPN for account and kerberoast to crack hash
	- [ ] *GenericAll*: Change user's password
	- [ ] *DS-Replication-Get-Changes-ALL*: DCSync Attack
	- [ ] *AddKeyCredentialLink* to get user's TGT (PtT)
- [ ] Check bloodhound for CanRDP, CanPSRemote, or SQLAdmin
- [ ] Check for common vulnerabilities:
	- [ ] NoPac
	- [ ] PrintNightmare
	- [ ] PetitPotam
- [ ] Check for misconfigurations
	- [ ] Exchange Group Permissions
	- [ ] MS-RPRN Printer Bug
	- [ ] MS14-068
	- [ ] LDAP Credentials Sniffing with netcat
	- [ ] Enumerate DNS Records with adidnsdump
	- [ ] Look for users password or other notes in users descriptions
	- [ ] Check for PASSWD_NOTREQD field and asreproast users found if possible.
	- [ ] Check for GPOs we have write access on to gain Administrator or move laterally (Bloodhound)
- [ ] Look for GPP Passwords
- [ ] Run PingCastle, Group3r, ADpeas and ADRecon.ps1 if we are stuck. 

## Attacking AD Trust (Parent Domain)
- [ ] Discover domain trust with Get-ADTrust, Get-DomainTrust or Bloodhound
- [ ] From a domain admin users attempt ExtraSIDs attack
- [ ] [[Trust Abuse Attacking Child -> Parent Trust]] (RaiseChild.py)

## Attacking AD Trust (Cross Forest)
- [ ] Discover Domain trust with Get-ADTrust, Get-DomainTrust or bloodhound
- [ ] Attempt cross forest kerberoasting
- [ ] Reuse credentials for same name users in others forest
- [ ] Check for SIDHistory Abuse
- [ ] [[Trust Abuse Attacking Cross Forest Trust]]
