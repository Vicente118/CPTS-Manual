#### 6. Sensitive Information 
- [ ] Look source code for sensitive informations (Comments, exposed code,...)
#### 7. Trigger Error Page
- [ ] Trigger error pages for potential leak information about stack, code,...
#### 8. Discover used technologies
- [ ] Wappalyzer for discovery
- [ ] Whatweb for discovery
