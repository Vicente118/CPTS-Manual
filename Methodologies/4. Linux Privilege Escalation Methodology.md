## If Webserver
#### 1. Web config files, source code and hardcoded creds
- [ ] Credential Hunting in web application folder
- [ ] Check source code for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Check source code for hardcoded credentials
- [ ] For Apache
	- [ ] `/var/www/html` default root for Apache on most distros
	- [ ] `/var/www` base directory for multiples sites
	- [ ] `/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf` vhost configuration
	- [ ] `apache2.conf` Global settings
	- [ ] `httpd.conf` Global settings
	- [ ] `.htaccess` Config that apply to the directory where it's located
- [ ] For Nginx
	- [ ] `/usr/share/nginx/html`
	- [ ] `var/www/html` 
	- [ ] `/etc/nginx/sites-available/ and /etc/nginx/sites-enabled` Config files
- [ ] Other locations
	- [ ] `/opt/web`
	- [ ] `/home/user/`
	- [ ] `/www` or `/html`

## Default Methodology
#### 1. Linux Automated Scripts
- [ ] LinPeas: Save output for offline examination
- [ ] LinEnum: Save output for offline examination
#### 2. Basic host enumeration
- [ ] User informations
	- [ ] User
	- [ ] Groups
- [ ] Network information
	- [ ] Route
	- [ ] Ifconfig
	- [ ] Arp
	- [ ] Netstat
- [ ] Sudo privilege `sudo -l`
- [ ] Check `/etc/hosts`
- [ ] Check OS / Kernel Version
- [ ] Check Env
- [ ] Check $PATH variable
- [ ] Discover other users `/etc/passwd` 
- [ ] Check for SSH Keys 
- [ ] Check for bash history
	- [ ] Current user
	- [ ] Other users
- [ ] List process
	- [ ] Run as everyone
	- [ ] Run as other intersting user
	- [ ] Run as root
- [ ] Check if `/etc/shadow` is readable
- [ ] Check if `/etc/passwd` is writable
- [ ] Enumerate groups
- [ ] Check for running cronjobs
	- [ ] `/etc/cron.*/`
	- [ ] `./pspy`
- [ ] Check for unmounted files systems and additional drives
	- [ ] Weak NFS Privilege
- [ ] Find writable files and directories
- [ ] Find all hidden files and directories
- [ ] Enumerate services and versions
- [ ] Check for readable config files
- [ ] Check for custom scripts
#### 3. Look for hardcoded Credentials
- [ ] Find non standards files and directories
- [ ] Look in `/opt`
- [ ] Look in web config files
- [ ] Try `Lazagne`
- [ ] Enumeration: credential hunting
#### 4. Look at privileges misconfig
- [ ] Check Sudo privilege
- [ ] Check SUID/GUID binary
#### 5. Check owned files
- [ ] Check for files that are owned by current user or group
#### 6. LD_PRELOAD
- [ ] Try LD_PRELOAD for binary that are run with higher privileges (SUID, sudo)
#### 7. Shared Object Hijack
- [ ] Try Shared Object Hijack on boianry that are run with hight privilege (SUID, sudo)
#### 8. Groups the user is part of
- [ ] Enumerate Groups
- [ ] LXC / LXD
- [ ] Docker 
- [ ] Disk
- [ ] ADM
#### 9. Check for PATH Abuse
- [ ] Check if we can hijack a high privileged binary with PATH abuse
#### 10. Wildcards abuse
- [ ] Check for wildcards abuse in cronjobs or custom scripts\
#### 11. Check for internal running services
- [ ] Use netstat to discover new internal services that may be vulnerable
#### 12. Check for other NICs 
- [ ] Check for other network interface in order to pivot later
#### 13. Check for cronjobs
- [ ] Running as root or other privileged users
- [ ] Use `pspy` or check `/etc/cron.*`
#### 14. Capabilities
- [ ] Check for binary with interesting capabilities
#### 15. Look for vulnerable services
- [ ] Enumerate services / binaries and check versions
#### 16. Logrogate
- [ ] Check for logrogate exploit
#### 17. Check for kernel exploit
- [ ] Github
- [ ] Exploitdb
- [ ] Metasploit
- [ ] Google
#### 18. Python Abuse
- [ ] Look for pythons scripts
- [ ] Check for Library Hijacking
#### 19. Netfilter
- [ ] Check if netfilter is vulnerable
#### 20. Tmux
- [ ] Check for hijackable tmux sessions
#### 21. Tcpdump
- [ ] Capture traffic with `tcpdump`
#### 22. Containers
- [ ] LXC / LXD
- [ ] Docker
- [ ] Kubernetes
